# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Turul-a2a is a Rust implementation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol v1.0. Licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0.

**Proto-first architecture**: Types are generated from the normative `proto/a2a.proto` (package `lf.a2a.v1`) using `prost` + `pbjson`, then wrapped in ergonomic Rust types.

**Current release**: 0.1.15 — see `CHANGELOG.md` for the per-release contract.

**All crate dependencies MUST use `workspace = true`** — versions are managed in root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]`. This includes dev-dependencies. Never put a version number in a crate's own `Cargo.toml` — add the dependency to the workspace root first, then reference it with `{ workspace = true }` in the crate.

## Git Conventions

- Commit messages: succinct, no Co-Authored-By attribution
- Do not push unless explicitly asked
- Version bumps: minor = 0.0.x (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.1.1), major = 0.x.0

## Release & Publish (crates.io)

The workspace publishes 6 crates. Publishing is irreversible (yank only hides). Never run `cargo publish` without explicit user instruction.

### Sequence (always in this order)

1. **Bump versions.** Edit `[workspace.package].version` in root `Cargo.toml`; every crate inherits via `version.workspace = true`. Also bump intra-workspace deps that carry an explicit version: `[workspace.dependencies]` entries for `turul-a2a-proto` / `turul-a2a-types`, plus the `{ version = "X.Y.Z", path = "..." }` lines inside crates that depend on other workspace crates (crates.io rejects path-only deps, so both fields are required).
2. **Write the CHANGELOG entry.**
3. **Run the pre-publish gate:**
   - `cargo test --workspace` green
   - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean
   - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean
   - `cargo doc --no-deps --workspace` no warnings
   - `cargo package -p <crate> --no-verify --allow-dirty` warning-free for every publish crate
4. **Commit the release-prep changes.** `cargo publish` refuses a dirty tree. Do not use `--allow-dirty` on real publishes — it is only for `cargo package` dry-runs.
5. **Push main.** `git push origin main`. If the push fails (merge conflict, branch protection, auth), stop and fix the local repo first. Do not publish from a tree that cannot be pushed.
6. **Tag and push the tag.** `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z — <one-liner>"` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`. The tag marks the commit that is about to be published.
7. **Publish in dependency order** (hard requirement — later crates cannot resolve otherwise):
   1. `turul-a2a-proto`
   2. `turul-a2a-types`
   3. `turul-a2a`
   4. `turul-a2a-client`, `turul-a2a-auth`, `turul-a2a-aws-lambda` (any order; none depend on each other)

Authorize each `cargo publish` call separately. A prior "go ahead" does not authorize future releases.

### crates.io rate limit

- Re-publishes of *existing* crates are effectively unthrottled.
- New-crate registrations: ~5 per 30-minute window, then one new crate per ~10 minutes. Account-wide.
- On HTTP 429, cargo returns the exact reset time. Wait that long; do not retry sooner.

### Per-crate invariants

- **LICENSE files:** every publish crate has `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT` symlinks to `../../LICENSE-*`. When adding a new publish crate, add both symlinks or the `.crate` archive ships with only the SPDX identifier.
- **Proto location:** `crates/turul-a2a-proto/proto/` is canonical so `cargo package` includes it. The workspace-root `proto/` symlink preserves historical paths — do not replace it with a real directory.
- **Lambda example `doc = false`:** every Lambda example crate declares `[[bin]] name = "bootstrap"` (cargo-lambda requirement). Each has `doc = false` on the bin target so `cargo doc --workspace` does not collide on output filenames.

## Architecture

### Crate Structure

- `turul-a2a-proto` — prost-generated types from `a2a.proto`. Build.rs generates via `prost-build` + `pbjson-build`. JSON serialization uses camelCase (proto JSON mapping) via pbjson.
- `turul-a2a-types` — Ergonomic Rust wrappers over proto types. Publishable, no server/storage/auth deps. `#[non_exhaustive]` on all public types. State machine enforcement on `TaskState`.
- `turul-a2a` — Server + storage + HTTP/JSON-RPC/SSE transports + auth middleware foundation. Feature-gated backends (in-memory default). `AgentExecutor` trait, `A2aMiddleware` trait, `A2aServer::builder()`.
- `turul-a2a-auth` — Concrete auth middleware: `BearerMiddleware` (JWT), `ApiKeyMiddleware`. Uses the external `turul-jwt-validator` crate.
- `turul-a2a-client` — Independent A2A client: discovery, send, get, cancel, list, auth, tenant.
- `turul-a2a-aws-lambda` — Lambda adapter: thin wrapper over same Router, request/response only (ADR-008).

### Preludes

- `turul_a2a::prelude::*` — server/agent authoring: `A2aServer`, `AgentExecutor`, `ExecutionContext`, `A2aError`, `AgentCardBuilder`, `Task`, `Message`, `Part`, `Artifact`, `TaskState`, `TaskStatus`
- `turul_a2a_client::prelude::*` — client/caller: `A2aClient`, `ClientAuth`, `MessageBuilder`, `SseEvent`, `SseStream`, `A2aClientError`, `ListTasksParams`; under `--features grpc` also re-exports `A2aGrpcClient` and `GrpcStreamResponses` (ADR-014 §2.7)

These are separate by design. Only add types that are genuinely part of the common happy path — do not turn preludes into "export everything."

### Proto Build Pipeline

`proto/a2a.proto` → `prost-build` (generates Rust structs) + `pbjson-build` (generates serde impls with camelCase JSON) → `turul-a2a-proto` crate → wrapped by `turul-a2a-types`

Google well-known types (`google.protobuf.Struct`, `Value`, `Timestamp`) mapped to `pbjson_types` via `compile_well_known_types()` + `extern_path`.

### Known Exceptions

- **Push notification configs** use raw `turul_a2a_proto::TaskPushNotificationConfig` in storage traits and handler signatures. Adopter-facing surfaces (the `turul-a2a-client` push-config methods and the `turul-a2a-types::PushConfig` / `PushAuth` / `PushConfigPage` wrappers) are wrapper-first; the proto leakage is bounded to the storage/handler boundary, where the symmetry with the proto is the simpler contract. Keep this leakage isolated; do not let raw proto types spread into general handler/router code or back out into adopter call sites.
- **`last_chunk` on `append_artifact`** is transport metadata for SSE streaming. Storage does not persist completion state; the server layer forwards `last_chunk` to streaming subscribers.

### Server Wiring: Push Delivery Is Strict Opt-In (0.1.5+)

`.storage(storage)` wires storage traits only, even though all four first-party backends implement `A2aPushDeliveryStore` on the same struct (ADR-009 same-backend requirement). Push delivery is opt-in at **both** levels:

- **Storage**: `InMemoryA2aStorage::new().with_push_dispatch_enabled(true)` (and equivalents per backend) so atomic commits write the pending-dispatch marker.
- **Builder**: `.push_delivery_store(storage.clone())` to register the consumer.

The builder rejects inconsistent configurations (ADR-013 §4.3). Non-push adopters need neither call.

### Multi-Instance Streaming Limitation

- The in-process event broker (`TaskEventBroker`) provides local fanout for attached clients on the **same instance only**.
- This is not a Lambda-specific limitation — it affects any multi-instance deployment: Lambda, load-balanced binaries, ECS/Fargate, Kubernetes, rolling deploys.
- Shared task storage (DynamoDB, PostgreSQL) solves request/response correctness across instances but does NOT solve streaming coordination.
- D3 (future): durable event store with monotonic IDs + replay semantics. The in-process broker becomes a local optimization, not the source of truth. See ADR-008.

### Architecture Decision Records

Long-form rationale lives under `docs/adr/`. ADR refs are durable internal anchors — keep them out of READMEs, crate-level `//!` docs, `pub` item `///` docs, and adopter-visible prose. Cite ADR numbers freely in private/inline source comments and CHANGELOG entries when they help future maintainers.

For non-trivial architecture changes, the ADR should be accepted before implementation starts.

### Example and API Surface Policy

- **Examples must prefer wrapper/helper APIs over raw proto mutation.** Repeated `as_proto().clone()` + manual proto construction in examples is a design smell — it signals the wrapper layer is missing a helper that should be designed.
- If a simple example needs generated-proto editing to do normal work (e.g., complete a task, add an artifact), stop and evaluate whether `Task`, `Artifact`, or related types are missing a helper method.
- Raw proto access (`as_proto()`, `as_proto_mut()`) is an escape hatch, not the primary path for common operations.

### Comment and Docstring Style

Do not reference internal task or phase names (e.g. "phase A", "D.2", task numbers, issue identifiers) in code comments, docstrings, or committed artifacts. Those labels are planning scaffolding — they rot once the phase ships and leak implementation history into the public surface. Write comments that describe the invariant, the contract, or the "why" in timeless terms. References to ADRs and to upstream specs (A2A spec sections, proto line numbers) are fine and encouraged — they are durable external anchors. If a constraint is only meaningful relative to an in-flight refactor, put it in the plan or PR description, not in source.

### TDD Discipline

Tests are written from the A2A proto/spec FIRST, then implementation follows. If code disagrees with tests, re-check `proto/a2a.proto` before changing anything. Only change tests when the test is wrong relative to the normative source.

### Wire Format (from proto annotations)

- Send: `POST /message:send` (with `/{tenant}/message:send`)
- Stream: `POST /message:stream`
- Get task: `GET /tasks/{id=*}`
- Cancel: `POST /tasks/{id=*}:cancel`
- Subscribe: `GET /tasks/{id=*}:subscribe`
- Extended card: `GET /extendedAgentCard`
- Discovery: `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`
- JSON-RPC: `POST /jsonrpc` (all 11 methods, PascalCase)
- TaskState: `TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED`, `TASK_STATE_WORKING`, etc.
- Error: TaskNotFoundError → 404/-32001, TaskNotCancelableError → 409/-32002, UnsupportedOperationError → 400/-32004, ContentTypeNotSupportedError → 415/-32005
- All A2A errors MUST include `google.rpc.ErrorInfo` with reason + domain

### Proto and Spec Compliance

Our vendored `proto/a2a.proto` is byte-identical to upstream `a2aproject/A2A/specification/a2a.proto`. Per spec §1.4, the proto is "the single authoritative normative definition" for data objects and messages.

**HTTP route patterns follow the proto's `google.api.http` annotations** (`/message:send`, `/tasks/{id=*}`, etc.).

**Spec-aligned behaviors:**
- SubscribeToTask: first event is Task object (spec §3.1.6), terminal tasks return UnsupportedOperationError
- Error codes: TaskNotCancelable=409, UnsupportedOperation=400, PushNotificationNotSupported=400
- Query params: camelCase (historyLength, pageSize, pageToken, contextId)
- contextId/taskId mismatch rejection on continuation (spec §3.4.3)

**Release scope.** turul-a2a is tested against the current upstream A2A v1.0 proto (`proto/a2a.proto`) and implements the core HTTP+JSON and JSON-RPC server surfaces covered by that vendored contract. Within those covered surfaces there are no known compliance gaps: ListTasks sorts by `updated_at DESC` across all four backends; pagination cursor encodes `updated_at|task_id` for stable iteration; the spec-compliance suite (`crates/turul-a2a/tests/spec_compliance.rs`) walks every core RPC on both transports.

**Out of scope for the framework release:**
- gRPC transport on AWS Lambda (ADR-014 §2.6: Lambda lacks persistent HTTP/2). The feature itself is fully wired for self-hosted targets (ECS / Fargate / AppRunner / Kubernetes / bare VMs) — see [ADR-014](docs/adr/ADR-014-grpc-transport.md) and `examples/grpc-agent`.
- Deployment-layer transport requirements: TLS 1.2+ (spec §7.1) and gzip (§11.4) are met at the reverse proxy / load balancer, not framework-enforced.
- Deeper per-skill security-scheme semantics (agent-level only; see "Deferred").

Before describing a release as "A2A v1.0 compliant", re-verify the vendored `proto/a2a.proto` SHA256 still matches `a2aproject/A2A:main/specification/a2a.proto` (AGENTS.md §55+§173).

### Deferred (ordered by priority)

1. **Skill-level `security_requirements` enforcement at request time** — blocked on upstream proto adding a normative skill binding on `Message`. ADR-015 ships declaration-only advertisement with post-merge truthfulness validation; runtime gatekeeping for a specific skill remains adopter responsibility inside `AgentExecutor`.
